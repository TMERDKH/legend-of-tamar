Her lover, on the other hand, had this gothic beauty to him - my favourite kind. It was raining when I met him. Painted in colours, but always cloudy and dark. As if he looks out for happiness but has accepted that the weather is just a little colder where he lives. Although Lisbon offered a sweeter kiss to my cheek, Porto stole my heart. He was distant. He had a story and all I wanted was to be part of it - to be part of him and to dance in his rain.", "dimensions": "20x20", "year" : "2017", "price" : "500$", "category" : "paintings"},
